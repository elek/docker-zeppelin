## Versioning policy

  The _latest_ tag points to the latest configuration loading and the latest stable apache version.

  The _testing_ usually points to a cutting edge developer snapshot or RC/alpha release but expected to be working. 

  If there is plain version tag without prefix it is synchronized with the version of the original apache software.

  It there is a prefix (eg. HDP) it includes a specific version from a specific distribution.

  As the configuration loading in the base image is constantly evolving even the tags of older releases may be refreshed over the time.
